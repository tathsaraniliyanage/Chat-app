# LIVE CHAT APPLICATION

This is a simple chat application built using Java Socket Programming. The application allows two users to communicate with each other in real-time over a network. It demonstrates the use of sockets, multithreading, and Java's I/O streams to create a basic client-server architecture.

## Features ðŸŒŸ

- **Two Interfaces**: The application consists of two separate interfaces (clients) that can communicate with each other.

- **Real-Time Messaging**: Messages are sent and received in real-time between the two clients.

- **Multi-Threading**: The server handles multiple clients simultaneously using threads, ensuring smooth communication.

- **Simple UI**: A basic graphical user interface (GUI) is provided for ease of use.

- **User friendly interfaces** - UI with additional features like emojis and file sharing.


## Future Enhancements

- Add support for group chats.
- Implement encryption for secure communication.


## How It Works

- **Server**: The server acts as a mediator between the two clients. It listens for incoming connections and relays messages between the clients.

- **Clients**: Each client connects to the server and can send and receive messages. The client interfaces are built using Java Swing for a simple and intuitive user experience.


## Technologies Used

- **Java Socket Programming**: For establishing communication between the server and clients.

- **Java Swing**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).

- **Multithreading**: To handle multiple clients and ensure non-blocking communication.
